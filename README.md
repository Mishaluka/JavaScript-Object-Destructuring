# JavaScript-Object-Destructuring
This project explores JavaScript object destructuring, a powerful ES6 feature that allows developers to extract properties from objects into variables efficiently. It includes real-world examples using structured book data.

✨ Features
🏗 Basic Object Destructuring: Extract properties from objects with ease.
🔄 Renaming Variables: Assign new names while destructuring.
🔍 Default Values: Handle missing object properties gracefully.
📑 Nested Object Destructuring: Access deeply nested properties.
📚 Practical Examples: Work with book data structures to understand real-world applications.

🛠 Technologies Used
JavaScript: Implements destructuring with ES6+ features.
HTML: Provides a simple console-based execution setup.

🚀 How to Use
Open the index.html file in a browser.
Open the console (Press F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I) to see the output.
Modify the script.js file to experiment with different object destructuring techniques.
